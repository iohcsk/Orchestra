    <span id="first" class="js">Woodwind</span> <span>instruments</span> are a family of musical <span>instruments</span> within the more general category of wind <span>instruments</span>.<br> Common examples include flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and saxophone. There are two main types of woodwind <span>instruments</span>: flutes and reed <span>instruments</span> (otherwise called reed pipes). The main distinction between these <span>instruments</span> and other wind <span>instruments</span> is the way in which they produce sound. All <span class="js">Woodwind</span> produce sound by splitting the air blown into them on a sharp edge, such as a reed or a fipple. Despite the name, a woodwind may be made of any material, not just wood. Common examples include brass, silver, cane, as well as other metals such as gold and platinum. The saxophone, for example, though made of brass, is considered a woodwind because it requires a reed to produce sound. Occasionally, <span class="js">Woodwind</span> are made out of earthen materials, especially ocarinas.
